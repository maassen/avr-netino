# avr-netino

This project summarizes some patches to the arduino core and bootloader to get the AVR-Net-IO board programmable by the arduino IDE. Additional included are some patched libraries to support the io functions of the board (network,LCD,RFM12,...)

The philosophy behind my changes is to support many avr's in the core files and to concentrate the board specific details in one file. So porting to other hardware should be very easy.

**Comments, suggestions and contributions are welcome!**
